                    <h4>The story of problem solving</h4>
                    <p>
                        While maintaining this home page (ywho.github.io), I was having the problem of duplicating the codes for side navigation bar in different blog pages. As the number of blogs increased, the workload increase also. To solve the problem of code duplication, I tried to do some google searching to see if I can include html file in some way. This will allow me to maintain single file only whenever I need to update the side navigation bar. Voila, I found a solution from w3school to use 'w3-include-html' attribute, together with 'w3.js' javascript script.      
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although the problem was solved, I faced new follow up problems. Anyway, let just focus on the first problem that I mentioned above. After solving the first problem, I was feeling really happy, because I can immediately see the effect of saving time in updating the side navigation bar.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From the experience, I learnt that there is always a solution at some place, because someone might have the same problem before me.

                        Problem Solving Process
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        When solving a coding problem, I usually use process such as: 'R eading error messages', 'Googling', 'Console.logging', 'Pseudocode', and 'Improving process with reflection'. There are no specific sequence in using those process. It is a personal judgement on which one is more suitable for certain scenario. In some real difficult case where I'm really stuck, I will start asking peers or coaches for help.

                    <p>
                        The .map() method will internally loop through every element in an array, then pass each element to a function to be processed. Each processed result will be saved in a new array. At the end of the looping, the new array will be returned as the result of the operation.

                    <p>
                        Let use washing machines as an example. All washing machines are built with several
                        functions: 'wash', 'rinse', and 'tumble-dry'. When we set
                        a washine machine to 'wash', the washing machine will perform
                        a series of operations such as: water-in, detergent-in, and
                        spin clothes. When we set a washine machine to 'rinse', the
                        washing machine will perform a series of operations such
                        as: water-in, spin, and water-out. When we set a washine
                        machine to 'tumble-dry', the washing machine will perform
                        a series of operations such as: water-out, and spin quickly.
                        One advantage about
                        <em>functions</em> is that we don't really need to know the detail
                        of the operations within
                        <em>functions</em>. We just need to know how to use
                        <em>functions</em> to achieve certain purposes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In coding, the
                        <em>functions</em> of a washing machine could be 'wash()', 'rinse()',
                        and 'tumble-dry()'. All the details of the operations are
                        encapsulated inside 'wash()', 'rinse()', and 'tumble-dry()'.
                        We could invoke 'wash()', 'rinse()', or 'tumble-dry()' as
                        many times as we need. The behaviours will be the same no
                        matter how many times a function is invoked. The reusablity
                        of same behaviours is the reason why functions are useful.
