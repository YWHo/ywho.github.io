                    <h4>The story of my problem solving</h4>
                    <p>
                        This home page (ywho.github.io) has the problem of code duplication at side navigation bar. Originally, every single post will need to have its side navigation updated individually. As the number of posts increased, the workload increase also. To solve the problem of code duplication, I tried to do some googling to see if I can include html file in some way. This will allow me to maintain just a single file whenever I need to update the side navigation bar. Voila, I found a solution from w3school. I just need to use 'w3-include-html' attribute and a link to 'w3.js' file in the script tag.      
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although the problem was solved, I faced new follow up problems. Anyway, let just focus on the first problem that I mentioned above. After solving the first problem, I was feeling really happy, because I can immediately see the effect of saving time in updating the side navigation bar.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From the experience, I learnt that there is always a solution at some place, because someone might have the same problem before me.

                        Problem Solving Process
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        When solving a coding problem, I usually use combination of process such as: 'Reading error messages', 'Googling', 'Console.logging', 'Pseudocode', and 'Improving process with reflection'. There are no specific sequence in using those process. It is a personal judgement on which one is more suitable for certain scenario. In some real difficult case where I'm really stuck, I will start asking peers or coaches for help. Regarding Rubber ducky method, I guess I did it all the time, when I tried to rephrase something technical using my own words to a non-technical person.

                    <h4>
                        About .map() in Javascript Array
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        The .map() method will internally loop through every element in an array, then pass each element to a function to be processed. Each processed result will be saved into a new array. At the end of the looping, the new array will be returned as the result of the operation.

                    <h4>About .filter() in Javascript Array</h4>
                    <p>
                        The .filter() method will internally loop though every element in an array, then test every element with the test condition provided. Any element that passed the test condition will be saved into a new array. At the end of the looping, the new array with those elements that passed the test condition, will be returned. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="question-answer">
                    <h4>About .reduce() in Javascript Array</h4>
                    <p>
                        The .reduce() method is a shortcut way to accumulate every element inside the array to a single result. First, it has a default <em>Total</em> that starts at 0. Then it will internally loop through every element from left to right. Each element will do mathematic operation with <em>Total</em>, and save the result back to <em>Total</em>. The new <em>Total</em> will be used for operation with the next element. The final result will be the accumulated results of the mathematic operation upon every element. Regarding the mathematic operation, it can be any operation as long as the operation involves both <em>Total<em> and an array element.
