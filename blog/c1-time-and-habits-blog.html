        <section class="card-view">
            <h4>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h4>
            <p>I tried to do meditation before sleep and doing task at smaller steps
                for bigger tasks. I found that I need to take a break time after
                25 mins. The small break seems quite similar to Pomodoro Technique,
                but not exactly. For Pomodoro-technique, it also involve review what
                has been done, and the break is only at about 5 mins, not more.
            </p>

        <section class="card-view">
            <h4>What did you find interesting?</h4>
            <p>The Fogg Method is really interesting. Its technique of
                <em>"trigger, tiny habit, then celebrate"</em> is really reliable for
                anyone to change own's behaviour easily. I like his example of "After
                I pee, I will do two push up. Then celebrate by saying I'm awesome!"
            </p>

            <h4>What worked for you?</h4>
            <p>Breaking down a task to a smaller tasks has worked for me. Following
                my natural rhythms also worked for me.
            </p>

        <section class="card-view">
            <h4>Which will you eperiment further with?</h4>
            <p>I will experiment further with Pomodoro Technique and Fogg Method. One
                is about accurate time estimation on tiny task; another is to change
                habit reliably. When both of them are combined together, they are
                really powerful.
