                Q. which timebox and habits techniques did you try? <br />
                A. I tried do to meditation before sleep and doing task at smaller steps for a big tasks. I found that I need to take a break time around after 25 mins. The small break seems to similar to Pomodoro Technique, but not exactly. For Pomodoro-technique, it also involve review what has been done, and the break is only at about 5 mins, not more.

                Q. what did you find interesting?<br />
                A. The Fogg Method is really interesting. Its technique of <em>"trigger, tiny habit, then celebrate"</em> is really reliable for anyone to change own's behaviour easily. I like his example of "After I pee, I will do two push up. Then celebrate by saying I'm awesome!"

                Q. what worked for you?
                A. Breaking down a task to a smaller tasks has worked for me. Following my natural rhythms also worked for me.

                Q. which will you eperiment further with?
                A. I will experiment further with Pomodoro Technique and Fogg Method. One is about accurate time estimation on tiny task; another is to change habit reliably. When both of them are combined together, they are really powerful.
