    <h1>Time and habits</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</strong>
            <br />
            I tried do to meditation before sleep and doing task at smaller steps for a big tasks. I found that I need to take a break time around after 25 mins. The small break seems to similar
            to Pomodoro Technique, but not exactly. For Pomodoro-technique, it also involve review what has been done, and the break is only at about 5 mins, not more.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What did you find interesting?</strong>
            <br />
            The Fogg Method is really interesting. Its technique of <em>"trigger, tiny habit, then celebrate"</em> is really reliable for anyone to change own's behaviour easily. I like his example of "After
            I pee, I will do two push up. Then celebrate by saying I'm awesome!"
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What worked for you?</strong>
            <br />
            Breaking down a task to a smaller tasks has worked for me. Following my natural rhythms also worked for me.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Which will you eperiment further with?</strong>
            <br />
            I will experiment further with Pomodoro Technique and Fogg Method. One is about accurate time estimation on tiny task; another is to change habit reliably. When both of them are combined together, they are
            really powerful.
