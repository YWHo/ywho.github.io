                    <h4>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h4>
                    <p>I tried to do meditation before sleep and doing task at smaller
                        steps for bigger tasks. I found that I need to take a short
                        break after 25 mins. The small break seems quite similar
                        to Pomodoro Technique, but not exactly. For Pomodoro-technique,
                        it also involve review what has been done, and the break
                        is only at about 5 mins, not more.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="question-answer">
                    <h4>What did you find interesting?</h4>
                    <p>The Fogg Method is really interesting. Its technique of
                        <em>"trigger, tiny habit, then celebrate"</em> is really reliable
                        for anyone to change own's behaviour easily. I like his example
                        of "After I pee, I will do two push up. Then celebrate by
                        saying I'm awesome!"
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="question-answer">
                    <h4>What worked for you?</h4>
                    <p>Breaking down a task to a smaller tasks has worked for me. Following
                        my natural rhythms also worked for me.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="question-answer">
                    <h4>Which will you eperiment further with?</h4>
                    <p>I will experiment further with Pomodoro Technique and Fogg Method.
                        One is about accurate time estimation on tiny task; another
                        is to change habit reliably. When both of them are combined
                        together, they are really powerful.
