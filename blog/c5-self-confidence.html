                        What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Mindfulness and self-awareness are the synonym of each other. They are same meanings from different angles.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="question-answer">
                    <h4>
                        Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Body scan help me aware and acknowledge that certain part of my body are tight and stressful. After the awareness and acknowledgement, the part of the body will start to relax. This is a good feeling. After the body scan, I felt sleepy also.
                    </p>

                <div class="question-answer">
                    <h4>
                        What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Most of the time, we have the tendency to view our emotions as ourselves. The choice of our words also reflected the tendency, such as: I'm angry; I'm happy; I'm sad. In reality, our emotions are not us. Through mindfulness observation, we will realize that emotions are just something that we felt, not what make us. The emotions are just a temporary phsychology effect. We could in fact observe our emotions through meta-attention. Next time, when we are feeling angry, happy, or sad, it is better to use words such as: I felt angry; I felt happy; I felt sad. These way of expression will help us to maintain the awareness of "My Emotions are Not Me".
