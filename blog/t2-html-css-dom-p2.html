            <h4>What is grid based design
            </h4>
            <p>In short, every columns and rows can be broken into smaller grids</p>

            <p>In the layout of a webpage, we visualise that there are invisible lines
                that cut the vertical space into 12 columns. Some html elements may
                take out 1 of the 12 columns. Some may need to take out more columns,
                such as 2, 3, 4 or 6 columns. The number 12 appears to be a magic
                number for columns, because it allows evenly spaced 2, 3, or 4 columns
                layout in a webpage.</p>

            <h4>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?
            </h4>
            <p>Various devices with various screen size could be used to open a webpage.
                The reason behind responsive webpages is that the webpage transform
                its appearance according to the size of the screen. For example,
                when users browse a webpage from their phones, the font size need
                to be bigger for easy reading and the buttons need to be bigger for
                finger gesture. Certain layout could be omitted to give a better
                viewing experience in smaller screen size. </p>

            <h4>What is semantic structure?</h4>
            <p>
                When using html tags to create a webpage, we use tags in a way that not only making
                sense to a browser, but making sense to human reading the tags also.
                For example, 'h1' tag is for the highest level of heading, while
                'h2' is for the second level heading, and 'h3' is for the third level
                heading. Using 'h3' as the highest level heading, then followed by
                'h1' as sub-heading will cause confusion.

            <h4>What is Media Queries?</h4>
            <p>Media Queries is a special tag used in CSS denoted as '@media'. Using
                media queries, the CSS properties could be changed depend on device,
                screen size, and color.

            <h4>What is CSS Reseting?</h4>
            <p>Due to various platform and version of browsers, the rendering of webpages
                might not be consistent for the same CSS design. To achieve cross
                platform and cross browsers compatibility, there is a technique called
                'CSS Resetting'. A special css file (eg. normalize.css) is loaded
                into a webpage to resets the styling of all HTML elements to a consistent
                baseline. </p>
