                    <h4>How does <em>JavaScript</em> compare to <em>HTML</em> and <em>CSS</em>?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Let use a house as an analogy. <em>HTML</em> is like the layout, frames and structure of a house. <em>CSS</em> is like the painting, wall papers, internal furnitures and external appearance of a house. <em>Javascript</em> will be like the behaviour (programming) of electrical applicances or devices inside a house.
                    </p>
                    <P>
                        The <em>HTML</em> may say: "Let there be a power switch". The <em>CSS</em> may say: "Let the power switch appear as a green push-button". The <em>JavaScript</em> will be the one who response to the pressing of the push-button to turn on a light for a specific duration.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        In summary, while <em>HTML</em>'s job is about structures, <em>CSS</em>'s job is about appearances, <em>JavaScript</em>'s job is about behaviours.
                    </P>

                    <h4>
                        Explain <em>control flow</em> and <em>loops</em> using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        <em>Control flow</em> is about decision making. For example, in the morning, when an alarm clock is blasting its sound, a person will wake up from his/her sleep. After the person wake up, a series of decision making will run through his/her mind. Is today a weekend? If yes, turn off alarm and go back to sleep. If no, better get ready for work. Am I'm still feeling sleepy? If yes, press the snooze button and get back to sleep for another 10 minutes. If no, turn off alarm and wake up. Is the house feeling cold? If yes, wear a few more layers before leaving the bed. If no, do nothing and leave the bed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Loop</em> is about repetition. A very simple example is the action of stirring a cup after putting a scoop of chocolate powder into hot water inside the cup. Brushing teeth is another example of repetition. Someone may start brushing the front teeth, then proceed to the left side, then the right side. After a while, the toothbrush is back to the front, repeat the procedures again.

                    <h4>
                        Explain the difference between accessing data from <em>arrays</em> and <em>objects</em>.
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        <em>Arrays</em> are structured in a way that things are lineup together from index 0, all the way to the end of a queue. It is like people queueing up while holding number card in their hands. For example, in a 10 people group, the first person is holding card number 0, the second person is holding card number 1, the third person is holding card number 3, and the last person is holding card number 9. To access an array element, we just need to refer to the position of an element. For example, when we are asking someone from the 10 people group to come forward, we just need to say, "the person holding card number 5, please come forward". 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Objects</em> are structured in key-value pairs (or name-value pairs). The order of the elements in an object is not important. The key (or name) is the unique value, be it a string value or an integer value. It needs to be unique because it is an element's identification. To access an element in an object, we just need to refer to the key (name) of an element. For example, in a 10 people group, everyone has their own name tag. The names are unique. When we are asking someone from the 10 people group to come forward, we just need to mention the name. If the person we are interested is called 'Alice', we just need to say, "Alice, please come forward".

                <div class="question-answer">
                    <h4>Explain what <em>functions</em> are and why they are useful.</h4>
                    <p>
                        <em>Functions</em> are a group of operations for specific purposes.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        Let use washing machines as an example. All washing machines are built with several functions: 'wash', 'rinse', and 'tumble-dry'. When we set a washine machine to 'wash', the washing machine will perform a series of operations such as: water-in, detergent-in, and spin clothes. When we set a washine machine to 'rinse', the washing machine will perform a series of operations such as: water-in, spin, and water-out. When we set a washine machine to 'tumble-dry', the washing machine will perform a series of operations such as: water-out, and spin quickly. One advantage about <em>functions</em> is that we don't really need to know the detail of the operations within <em>functions</em>. We just need to know how to use <em>functions</em> to achieve certain purposes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In coding, the <em>functions</em> of a washing machine could be 'wash()', 'rinse()', and 'tumble-dry()'. All the details of the operations are encapsulated inside 'wash()', 'rinse()', and 'tumble-dry()'. We could invoke 'wash()', 'rinse()', or 'tumble-dry()' as many times as we need. The behaviours will be the same no matter how many times a function is invoked. The reusablity of same behaviours is the reason why functions are useful.
