                    <h4>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h4>
                    <p>
                        DBC (the ‘sister’ of EDA) was an accidental bootcamp that appear to has the successful
                        teaching/learning model. The learning environment in the
                        bootcamp is quite different from the usual academy style
                        of teaching and learning. From the long time prep work to
                        the intensive 9-week training, students will have the opportunity
                        to learn beyond technical skills of coding. Shereef’s sharing
                        disclosed that the bootcamp also provide the environment
                        for someone to pick up soft skills such as persistency, humility,
                        empathy and self awareness. All these will make the person
                        stand up from the rest of normal programmers during job hunting.

                    <h4>What are your impressions?</h4>
                    <p>Before listening to Shereef’s sharing, I really viewed EDA bootcamp
                        from the
                        <em>“restaurant mindset”</em>, instead of
                        <em>“kitchen mindset”</em>. What is in the menu? What is the
                        price tag? Is it worth it? All I care about was what am I
                        getting back for the amount of money I paid. From his sharing,
                        I understand that I’m not just in the receiving side, my
                        contribution and commitment could help to shape the experience
                        of every participants in the bootcamp.

                <div class="question-answer">
                    <h4>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h4>
                    <p>Although understanding that I’m like one of the chef in a kitchen,
                        contributing to the making of a broth during the bootcamp,
                        I still do not have any clear idea how and what I could do
                        to contribute to the sucess of the bootcamp. May be I become
                        a mentor to the weaker student, and be a good follower to
                        the stronger student during the pair programming. May be
                        I need to give an honest feedback to help my pairing partner
                        to improve, while the feedback will be delivered in a more
                        positive tone to avoid hurting the feeling of my pairing
                        partner. It will be quite a challenge for me to keep on using
                        positive tones, because I tend to use a lot of negative tones.
                        One thing for sure, I must constantly remind myself that
                        the students in the bootcamp are not those that I’m competing
                        with. Instead, they are part of a big team that we collaborate
                        and support each other to grow.

                <div class="question-answer">
                    <h4>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h4>
                    <p>The sharing from Shereef helped to reinforced my expectation
                        on EDA that the bootcamp is not just about technical training.
                        In fact, I could pick up any technical skills without going
                        through bootcamp training. What I value most, is the oppportunity
                        on the soft-skill development. I’m looking forward to get
                        myself deeply immerse in the environment that allow the growing
                        of the ability of empathy, collaboration and positive articulation.
                        I hope that by the end of the bootcomp, I won't just come
                        out as a web developer only. I hope that I would be transformed
                        to be a good team player, a leader, a mentor, a humble student
                        and an engineer with full of emphathy and self-awareness.

                    <h4>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment?
                        Does it make you nervous?</h4>
                    <p>Yes, I'm feeling nervous if this will really help me to transform.
                        Well, let see what happen after a few months from now.
