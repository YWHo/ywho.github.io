            <h4>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical
                friend?
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML is like the structure of a house. In a house, the roof, the beam, the kitchen, the bathroom, the doors
                    are fixed in a specific location. Writing HTML is like a builder buiding a house. </li>
                <li>CSS is like the furnitures, decoration, wallpaper or painting of a house. Writing CSS is like doing external
                    painting, minor renovation, and internal design of a house.</li>
                <li>DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a reverse tree model of root, trunk and leaves to represent the
                    parent-children relationship of the html tags. It is kind of like a blueprint or a map of a house. The
                    blueprint or map allow builder or interior designer to know where can they build, modify and install
                    a new kitchen cabinet.</li>

            <h4>What is meant by boxifying design?</h4>
            <p>
                Boxifying design means that all the presentation views in a webpage can be cut into smaller pieces of rectagular shape. A heading
                title can be cut into a rectangular shape; a paragraph can be cut into a rectangular shape; a circle can
                be cut into a rectangular shape; an image can be cut into a rectangular shape. When viewing all piece of
                visual elements in design mocks as various rectangular shapes, a web developer could reproduce the design
                through html and CSS coding.
