                    <h4>
                        What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        In the past, I worked under someone having the quality of compassionate leadership.
                        He had all the three components of cognitive ("I understand
                        you"), affective ("I feel for you"), and motivational ("I
                        want to help you"). When he was just a Senior Engineer, I
                        didn't see the components from him. As an Intermediate Engineer,
                        I just thought that he was a weak and soft spoken person.
                        And I doubt that he had the capability to manage a team under
                        his soft shell when he was promoted to manage a team. (To
                        put you into perspective, the other managers were like fierce
                        tigers and dragons that won't let go the preys in their mouth.
                        They are the perfect example of not compassionate leadership)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There was a time my team was lacking a manager. The person was assigned to be the
                        manager in my team. When the news broke up that the person
                        will be our manager, one of my colleagues rose his thumb
                        and said that: "Good news!". Well, I doubted his excitement.
                        Anyway, the colleague was someone I respected. So, I took
                        his words and felt hopeful that we will be getting a good
                        manager. The immediate effect I noticed when working for
                        the new manager can be described in one word: "Comfortable".
                        The next thing, I felt that I could trust him and ask for
                        his help when I was in trouble with my work. As we continue
                        working together, I finally can see the secret power behind
                        his soft shell. In one of the projects, the new software
                        tool that I worked on was under the risk of not meeting the
                        schedule, putting the whole project at risk. The first thing
                        he did, was to understand about my situation and the reason
                        of cannot deliver on time. He felt my frustration on the
                        situation and he knew that I was taking blame for the delay
                        in the project. Then, he used his negotiation skills to help
                        me to get agreement from my stakeholders to prioritize the
                        tasks so that some tasks could be delivered after the critical
                        milestone. He helped me went through my career crisis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My colleague once told me a story regarding what he observed. There was a time when
                        a senior manager meeting with a group of managers to discuss
                        some issues. Whenever the other managers expressing their
                        opinions, the senior manager could not agree with them. But
                        when it was my compassionate manager speaking, the senior
                        manager listen really carefully and agree to what he said.

                <div class="question-answer">
                    <h4>
                        Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        After doing multiplying goodness meditation, the goodness felt abundant. Multiplying
                        goodness also make me feeling happy and useful (because of
                        contributing goodness).
                    </p>

                    <h4>
                        Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        It was not easy to do. It could lead to depression if perspective was wrong (need
                        elevated perspective), or transformation was omitted (need
                        to let dark cloud disperse and transform to ray of lights).
                        After completing the process, I could felt myself at ease,
                        confidence and capable of giving kindness. (May be it was
                        a coincidence, my partner came to hug me after 5 minutes
                        of finishing Tonglen meditation. I secretly used her as a
                        practice target)

                    <h4>
                        How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply
                        to bootcamp?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        SCARF = Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness, Fairness
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Status: I could feel the status reward when my mastery of HTML, CSS and Javascript
                        grew. I knew that I accidentally triggered status threat
                        when I told Harrison that the coding task was not challenging
                        and he promised me that I will feel sorry in phase-1.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Certainty: Let take the calculator project that I worked on as an example. I knew
                        that the original calculator project was not difficulty for
                        me (certainty), so I decided to stretch further to work on
                        a more complex version of the calculator (uncertainty). After
                        started working on the complex version of the calculator,
                        I found that the project was more difficult than my original
                        estimation (uncertainty). I split the work to different stages
                        so that I could conquer them one step at a time (certainty).
                        As more features were finished (certainty), I had less worry
                        about the undone features (uncertainty). Eventually, I finished
                        everything, and finally felt a sense of peace within me (certainty).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Autonomy: I would like to finish the tasks on time, every week. However, there usually
                        got something happened in the real life that need my immediate
                        attention. I felt helpless and stress when the thing in real
                        life make me behind the schedule.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Relatedness: The first weekly check-in were both excited and scary. Everyone was
                        a stranger to me (foe). I didn't feel comfortable to speak
                        to so many strangers at once. As the strangers started sharing
                        their stories, personal and technical, I seems to know them
                        better (friend), and felt more at ease.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fairness: Everyone in the bootcamp will be going through the same syllabus (fairness).
                        But I have advantages over them due to my previous background
                        (unfairness). I could sense that some of them need help,
                        so I took on mentoring role to help those who needed help.
                        (fairness)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Understanding SCARF is an important first step. It should help me to be a better
                        team player toward my peers during phase-1 bootcamp.

                        Erm, let me try to talk to Rohan about giving me 50% rebate on the bootcamp course
                        fee. Well, may be not. The author of 'Search Inside Yourself'
                        advise that “Sometimes, the right thing to do is not to raise
                        the issue at all.” Sorry for the disappointment, please tune
