                        What did you learn from your '
                        <em>mindfulness conversation</em>'? How did the other person
                        find it?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        I tried to do 4 minutes mindfulness conversation with my family members. It was funnily
                        awkward. My family and me have never do this kind of conversation
                        before. Usually, we just say it when we feel like we wanted
                        to talk. We may or may not pay attention to really listen
                        to what the other person was saying. When it was the turn
                        for one of my family members to say something, the person
                        found awkward and don't know what to continue to say after
                        2 minutes of speaking. For the remaining time, the person
                        choose to just silence. Being a listener, I really can feel
                        that I did pay full attention to the person who spoke. May
                        be because I played by the rule that I should be quiet. Or
                        may be because I have the confidence that I will have my
                        chance to say something when it was my turn. It was a great
                        experiment but I suspect 4 minutes might be too long and
                        not a practical duration for me and my family.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On next attempt, I reduced the duration to 1 minute mindfulnes. I found that this
                        duration seems to be just right. Both speaker and listener
                        won't feel awkward. As we took turn and switch role, I found
                        that 1 minute was good enough for us to say what we wanted
                        to say without pressure. Sometimes I might face the problem
                        of feeling like I still have more things to say but the 1
                        minute timer was up. However, I also realise that the desire
                        to say more was because I probably didn't use the 1 minute
                        duration to properly expressing my thought. It was a funny
                        experience for my family because it felt like we were playing
                        a mini family game where everyone take turn to speak for
                        only 1 minute.

                <div class="question-answer">
                    <h4>
                        Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        The book gave three suggestions:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Have a buddy</li>
                        <li>Do less than you can</li>
                        <li>Take one breath a day</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        All three suggested techniques are good, but I personally prefer the 2nd and 3rd
                        suggestions, because those seem very easy for me. I don't
                        think the first suggestion is practical for my lifestyle
                        yet.

                    <h4>
                        Any other musings?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        I plan to encourage my family to keep on playing the 1 minute mindfulness conversation
                        game. I believe it will create a strong bonding and understanding
                        for everyone in my family.
