<h1>Reflection on Shereef's Fireside Chat</h1>

    <p>
        DBC (the ‘sister’ of EDA) was an accidental bootcamp that appear to has the successful teaching/learning model. The learning environment in the bootcamp is quite different from the usual academy style of teaching and learning. From the long time prep work
        to the intensive 9-week training, students will have the opportunity to learn beyond technical skills of coding. Shereef’s sharing disclosed that the bootcamp also provide the environment for someone to pick up soft skills such as persistency,
        humility, empathy and self awareness. All these will make the person stand up from the rest of normal programmers during job hunting.

        Before listening to Shereef’s sharing, I really viewed EDA bootcamp from the <em>“restaurant mindset”</em>, instead of <em>“kitchen mindset”</em>. What is in the menu? What is the price tag? Is it worth it? All I care about was what am I getting back for the amount of
        money I paid. From his sharing, I understand that I’m not just in the receiving side, my contribution and commitment could help to shape the experience of every participants in the bootcamp.

        Although understand that I’m like one of the chef in a kitchen, contributing to the making of a broth during the bootcamp, I still do not have any clear idea how and what I could do to contribute to the sucess of the bootcamp. May be I become a mentor to the weaker student, and be
        a good follower to the strong student during the pair programming. May be I need to give an honest feedback to help my pairing partner to improve, while the feedback will be delivered in a more positive tone to avoid hurting the feeling of my pairing partner.
        It will be quite a challenge for me to keep on using positive tones, because I tend to use a lot of negative tones. One thing for sure, I must constantly remind myself that the students in the bootcamp are not those that I’m competing with. Instead,
        they are part of a big team that we collaborate and support each other to grow.

        The sharing from Shereef helped to reinforced my expectation on EDA that the bootcamp is not just about technical training. In fact, I could pick up any technical skills without going through bootcamp training. What I value most, is the oppportunity on the soft-skill development. I’m looking forward to get myself deeply immerse in the environment that allow the growing of the ability of empathy, collaboration
        and positive articulation. I hope that by the end of the bootcomp, I won't just come out as a web developer only. I hope that I would be transformed to be a good team player, a leader, a mentor, a humble student and an engineer with full of emphathy and self-awareness. Yes, I'm feeling nervous if this will really happen. Well, let see what happen after a few months from now.
