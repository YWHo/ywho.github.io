                    <h4>What learnings did you take from the chapter?
                    </h4>
                    <p>From the first chapter, I learnt that Emotional Intelligence
                        could help someone to achieve a greater success in life.
                        Someone who is strong in Emotional Intelligence will automatically
                        has the trait of happiness, resilience, optimism, and kindness.
                        One may not be strong in Emotional Intelligence at birth,
                        but luckily it is trainable. I have thought that Emotional
                        Intelligence is about keep on reminding myself to be nice
                        to others. But I was wrong. It is not about pretending to
                        be nice. It is in fact a deep awareness that allow detection
                        and regulation of own's emotional signals that lead to a
                        better decision in action toward the external stimulus. The
                        proper way to grow Emotional Intelligence, is start from
                        mindfulness training, to raise our concentration and awareness.
                        From the mindfulness training, we grow our self-awareness
                        that bring the natural tranformation of our personality.
                        This is all possible because mindfulness training will allow
                        us to regulate the part of our brians as primitive as amygdala.
                        Just two minutes a day of mindfulness training is what is
                        needed to grow our Emotional Intelligence
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="question-answer">
                    <h4>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?
                    </h4>
                    <p>The two minutes training is a good idea. It is just enough duration
                        before our distraction kick in and took over our mindfulness
                        attention. It seems achievable because we just need two minutes
                        of our time. It is easy to squeeze out two minutes from our
                        busy daily routine. I hope I will be able to do more than
                        2 minutes of mindfulness in the future.</p>
