        <h1>Cultural - Emotional Intelligence</h1>
        <section class="card-view">
            <h4>What learnings did you take from the chapter?
            </h4>
            <p>From the first chapter, I learnt that Emotional Intelligence could help
                someone to achieve a greater success in life. Someone who is strong
                in Emotional Intelligence will automatically has the trait of happiness,
                resilience, optimism, and kindness. One may not be strong in Emotional
                Intelligence at birth, but luckily it is trainable. I have thought
                that Emotional Intelligence is about keep on reminding myself to
                be nice to others. But I was wrong. It is not about pretending to
                be nice. It is in fact a deep awareness that allow detection and
                regulation of own's emotional signals that lead to a better decision
                in action toward the external stimulus. The proper way to grow Emotional
                Intelligence, is start from mindfulness training, to raise our concentration
                and awareness. From the mindfulness training, we grow our self-awareness
                that bring the natural tranformation of our personality. This is
                all possible because mindfulness training will allow us to regulate
                the part of our brians as primitive as amygdala. Just two minutes
                a day of mindfulness training is what is needed to grow our Emotional
                Intelligence
            </p>

            <h4>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?
            </h4>
            <p>The two minutes training is a good idea. It is just enough duration before
                our distraction kick in and took over our mindfulness attention.
                It seems achievable because we just need two minutes of our time.
                It is easy to squeeze out two minutes from our busy daily routine.
                I hope I will be able to do more than 2 minutes of mindfulness in
                the future.</p>
